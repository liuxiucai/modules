# Plan for New Modules Implementation

This document outlines the plan for building a new implementation to support ECMAScript modules in Node.js. The effort is split up into phases:

* **Phase 0** branches off of current Node but removes much of the Node 8.5.0+ `--experimental-modules` implementation so that a new implementation could be built in its place.

* **Phase 1** adds the “minimal kernel,” features that the modules working group felt would likely appear in any potential new ES modules implementation.

* **Phase 2** fleshes out the implementation with enough functionality that it should be useful to average users as a minimum viable product.

  - At the completion of Phase 2, the old `--experimental-modules` implementation was [replaced](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26745) with this new one (still behind the `--experimental-modules` flag). It was released as part of Node 12 on 2019-04-23.

* **Phase 3** improves user experience and extends the MVP.

  - At the completion of Phase 3, the new implementation’s experimental flag will be dropped. Per the modules group meeting on 2019-10-30, the implementation will be “released” (the `--experimental-modules` flag dropped) in November 2019.

* **Phase 4** are items that were under development in earlier phases but weren’t finished when the new implementation’s experimental flag was dropped; these items may continue development after unflagging and potentially ship in later versions of Node.js.

The effort is currently in **[Phase 3](#phase-3-path-to-stability-removing---experimental-modules-flag)**, with unflagging of `--experimental-modules` expected in November 2019.

At every phase, the following standards must be maintained:

* Spec compliance ([#132](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/132)): We must always follow the ES spec.
* Browser equivalence ([#133](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/133)): There’s room for debate in specific cases, but in general if Node is doing something that browsers also do, Node should do it in the same way. Alternatively, code that executes in both environments should produce identical results.
* Don’t break CommonJS ([#112](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/112)): We cannot cause breaking changes with regards to CommonJS.

See also the [features list in the README](https://github.com/nodejs/modules#features).

## Phase 0: Start Fresh

From current shipping Node, the following changes were made to strip out most of the Node 8.5.0+ `--experimental-modules` implementation so that a new implementation could be built in its place:

* Remove support in the `import` statement of formats other than ESM:
  - No CommonJS.
  - No JSON.
  - No native modules.

* Remove dynamic path searching:
  - No extension adding.
  - No directory resolution, including no support for `index.js` or `index.mjs`.
  - No support for `main` field for ESM.

* Remove current VM implementation

* Remove current Loader implementation

These changes were implemented in https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/6.

## Phase 1: The Minimal Kernel

The “minimal kernel” consists of features that the @nodejs/modules group have agreed will be necessary for all potential iterations of our ESM implementation. Phase 1 does _not_ include features that preclude other potential features or implementation approaches; and Phase 1 also does not include some features that should naturally be built in a later phase of development, for example because those features depend on features planned for Phase 1.

* `module.createRequireFromPath` ([nodejs/node#19360](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19360)) is the only way to import CommonJS into an ES module, for now.
  - `import.meta.require` fails at runtime as opposed to import time. This is not desireable to all committee members.
  - Hold off on `import` statements for CommonJS until more progress is made on the dynamic modules spec.
  - Landed in core in https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/246f6332e5a5f395d1e39a3594ee5d6fe869d622

* `import` statements will only support files with an `.mjs` extension, and will import only ES modules, for now.
  - No JSON or native modules; `createRequireFromPath` can be used to get these.

* `import.meta.url`.
  - Already in the existing implementation.

* Dynamic `import()`.
  - Already in the existing implementation.

* Support for built-in modules with named exports
  - Already in the existing implementation.

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product: Required to Upstream

Phase 2 fleshes out the implementation with enough functionality that it should be useful to average users as a minimum viable product. At the completion of Phase 2, the old `--experimental-modules` implementation was replaced with this new one (still behind the `--experimental-modules` flag).

* Define semantics for importing a package entry point, e.g. `import _ from 'lodash'`
  - Proposal: [“File Specifier Resolution” proposal](https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-import-file-specifier-resolution-proposal) covers bare module specifier resolution of CommonJS packages.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/28.

* Define semantics for determining when to load sources as CommonJS or ES module for both the top-level main (`node x.js`) and dependency loading.
  - Proposal: [“File Specifier Resolution” proposal](https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-import-file-specifier-resolution-proposal) covers `import` statements of ESM files; and CommonJS files, package entry point and package deep imports.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/28.

* Define semantics for enabling ESM treatment of source code loaded via `--eval`, STDIN, and extensionless files (both with and without shebang lines).
  - Proposal: [“Entry Points Proposal”](https://github.com/geoffreybooth/node-esm-entry-points-proposal) covers non-file forms of input as well as adding `--type` flag for controlling file-based input.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/32.
  - Renamed to `--entry-type` as part of upstream [PR](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26745) to Node.js core.
  - Renamed to `--intry-type` and limited to `--eval`, `--print` and `STDIN` as part of follow-up [PR](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27184) to Node.js core.

* File extension and directory index searching in ESM, behind its own flag, `--es-module-specifier-resolution`.
  - See https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/268.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/48.

The work through the end of Phase 2 landed in Node.js `master` as part of https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26745 and was released in Node 12.0.0.

## Phase 3: Path to Stability: Removing `--experimental-modules` Flag

Phase 3 improves user experience and extends the MVP. Phase 3 is malleable based on how things proceed while working on this phase. At the end of this phase, the `--experimental-modules` flag is dropped.

* Better mechanism for creating `require` function: `createRequire`.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27405 and shipped in 12.2.0.

* `"exports"` field: for consumers of a package, map the paths of deep imports to provide encapsulation (an explicit public API); pretty specifiers (no file exensions or paths that include things like `dist/`) and flexibility for future package versions renaming or moving files without affecting the package’s public API. Applies to both ESM and CommonJS.
  - Proposal: [Package Exports Proposal](https://github.com/jkrems/proposal-pkg-exports).
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28568 and shipped in 12.7.0 behind `--experimental-exports`. Further improvements are being made as additional PRs against core.
  - The separate `--experimental-exports` flag was dropped in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29867, merging the feature with overall `--experimental-modules`.

* Define behavior for builtin globals between CommonJS and ESM. Does modifying a builtin in one module system carry over into the other? If it does, we may have major performance concerns.
  - Issue raised in: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29426.
  - Solution was to not sync bindings automatically, but provide an API to manually sync them when desired: `module.syncBuiltinESMExports()`.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29737 and shipped in 12.12.0.

* Shortcut to resolve to package root.
  - Proposal: [Package `"name"` Resolution Proposal](https://github.com/guybedford/package-name-resolution).
  - Discussion: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/306.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29327 behind the flag `--experimental-resolve-self`.

* Finalize behavior of `import` of CommonJS files and packages.
  - Overview: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/264.
  - At time of unflagging: `import` only the CommonJS default export, so `import _ from 'cjs-pkg'` but not `import { shuffle } from 'cjs-pkg'`.
  - [Conditional exports](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29978) allows creating an ESM wrapper to provide named exports of an otherwise all-CommonJS package; see [“Approach #1: Use an ES Module Wrapper.”](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/api/esm.md#approach-1-use-an-es-module-wrapper)
  - No further improvements are expected.

* Dual CommonJS/ESM packages: Support packages with both CommonJS and ESM sources that can be used in either environment.
  - At time of unflagging: `"main"` (or `"exports": { ".": "file.js" }` overriding `"main"`) points to exactly one file, and full filenames are required (by default), so there is no possibility of an `import` specifier pointing to different files in ESM versus CommonJS; unless `--experimental-conditional-exports` is used (see next bullet). Without that flag, dual packages must provide secondary entry point via a path, e.g. `'pkg/module'` or `'pkg/commonjs'`.
  - With `--experimental-conditional-exports`, paths within the `package.json` `"exports"` block can have separate entry points per environment.
  - Landed in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/29978 and https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/30051 behind `--experimental-conditional-exports` flag.
  - Some members of the group expressed hesitation about conditional exports and want to explore other potential solutions for dual packages. If no alternative proposal reaches consensus before the end of January 2020, the `--experimental-conditional-exports` flag will be dropped and conditional exports will ship.

## Phase 4: Further Improvements After Unflagging

* Dual CommonJS/ESM packages: See previous section.
  - One alternative proposal is `require` of ESM: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/299.
  - **Status**: `--experimental-conditional-exports` will unflag by the end of January 2020 unless consensus is reached on an alternative approach. The flag may be dropped sooner if a consensus is reached, either for an alternative solution or for `--experimental-conditional-exports`.

* A loaders solution that supports all items in the [features list in our README](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/#features).
  - Discussion: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/351.
  - Design: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J0zDFkwxojLXc36t2gcv1gZ-QnoTXSzK1O6mNAMlync/edit#heading=h.xzp5p5pt8hlq.
  - **Status**: In development behind `--experimental-loader` flag.

* Limited module type detection.
  - PR: https://github.com/nodejs/ecmascript-modules/pull/69.
  - Upstream PR: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27808.
  - **Status**: Upstream PR submitted.

* Provide a way to make ESM the default instead of CommonJS.
  - Discussion: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/318.
  - Proposal: https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/335.
  - **Tabled**. Currently one can add `--input-type=module` to `NODE_OPTIONS` to flip the default for `--input-type`; at the moment the group is deciding not to pursue providing an ability to flip the default for the `package.json` `type` field. We instead want to encourage all packages, both ESM and CommonJS, to include an explicit `type` field; leaving it out and relying on a default is something we want to discourage.
